        <p>Although no definitive historical evidence for the Chin dog has been researched, it is mentioned in the
            Myanmar Encyclopedia, Volume II as Chin Dogs with short stature.In addition, in a novel written by Theikpan
            Maung Wa,[2] the main characters are Ar Mate and Lwe Zaw, the furry-tailed Chin dogs brought from Chin
            State, Myanmar.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>In the past, mostly in Egypt, people kept cats because the cats hunted and ate mice and rats. The
            oldest
            evidence of cats kept as pets is from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, around 7500 BC. Ancient Egyptians
            worshipped cats as gods, and often mummified them so they could be with their owners "for all of eternity".

            Today, people often keep cats as pets. There are also domestic cats which live without being cared for by
            people. These cats are called "feral cats" or "stray cats".</p>

    <blockquote cite="https://www.akc.org/">
        <p id="3">Siberian Husky, a thickly coated, compact sled dog of medium size and great
            endurance, was developed to work in packs, pulling light loads at moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses.
            Sibes are friendly, fastidious, and dignified. The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky's almond-shaped
            eyes
            can be either brown or blue'and sometimes one of each'and convey a keen but amiable and even mischievous
            expression. Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait.
            Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly
            cousin,
            the Alaskan Malamute. As born pack dogs, they enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs. The Sibe's
            innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs. These are energetic dogs who can't resist chasing
            small
            animals, so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature of the breed: Sibes are naturally clean,
            with
            little doggy odor. </p>
